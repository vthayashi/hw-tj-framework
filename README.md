# ðŸ›  Proposed Framework for Hardware Trojan Detection

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **"Proposed Framework.ipynb"**, which presents a framework for **hardware trojan detection and analysis** using **machine learning** and **large language models (LLMs)**. The notebook includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization** of results.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- âœ… **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Reads datasets from **TrustHub, RISC-V, MIPS, Web3, and PQC**.  
- âœ… **Machine Learning Models**: Implements **Decision Trees, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, KNN, SVM, and LLM-based approaches**.  
- âœ… **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses **Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score** for model comparison.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. It is suggested to use Google Colab.
Installation and setup are also included in the Python notebook.

---

## ðŸš€ Usage
Open `Proposed Framework.ipynb` and execute the cells **step by step**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
The notebook includes **detailed experimental results** comparing different approaches for **hardware trojan detection**, highlighting the effectiveness of **LLMs and traditional machine learning models**.

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements
With a standard Google Colab, the libraries are installed using pip (included in the Python Notebook).
